# vector
- This document provides an overview of vectors in C++.
- Vectors are part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and are used to create dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink in size.
- They provide a flexible way to manage collections of elements, offering functionalities such as insertion, deletion, and access to elements.
- Vectors handle memory management automatically, making them easier to use compared to traditional arrays.
- Vectors follow dynamic memory allocation, with memory being used efficiently.
- Vectors are typically allocated on the heap, not the stack.
